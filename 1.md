## Thoughts about UPS powered homelab

The current server **rocky** does only draw between 7 and 12 Watts which would
actually make it possible to run the server on batteries.
Running the server and acompaniing equipment on battery does have some benifits:

- less stress for electronics by less fluctuations
- resistance against power outages
- cost (batteries can be charged while cheaper solar electicity is produced)

Needed capacity (still to be measured properly):

- 15W rocky
- <24W PoE powered cameras
- 40W? additional storage
- ~20W switch

Running the minimal homeserver equipment will likely amout to about 100W.

```
100W * 18h = 1800Wh = 1.8 kWh
```

Assuming the battery should take the server safely over the night with some
margin for degration the battery should have a size of 1.5 - 2 kWh.

### Cost

To calculate the base budget for the project the cost should break even withing
2-3 years.

```
100W * 24h/d * 365 d/y = 876 kWh/y
876 kWh/y * 1/3 = 292 kWh/y (night)
876 kWh/y * 2/3 = 584 kWh/y (day)

# current cost
292 kWh/y * 0.29E + 584 kWh/y * 0.079E = 130.8E/y

# optimized cost
876 kWh/y * 0.079E = 69.2E/y
```

With about 62E euros per year to be saved the budged amounts to about **155E**.
All cost exceeding this will have to be covered from my play fund.
Even though this might be possible this does not make much sense when the actual
cost are too far beyond the calculated amount.
Sadly the cost of a 2kWh battery alone (not including inverters, voltage
regulators etc.) already amouts to about 500E.
This in turn means the hardware required for this has be obtained a bit more creative.
